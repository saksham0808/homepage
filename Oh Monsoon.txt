Oh ye gods, what ye have for us?
Health, laughter and no pain?
For I hear the brisk breeze,
The rustling leaves and the rain.

Up from the horizon,
Crowning the trees you rise.
Oh the grand clouds,
A feast to the eyes.

Chirp you little birdies chirp,
One day you'll too fly.
Sour you eagles soar,
Your limit is the sky.

Pitter patter rain it pours,
Down my window it flows,
Oh god how pleased are ye?
What else you have in store?

Oh here you come, you monsoon,
Oh you blow me away.
Missed these lovely sights so long,
Pray you're here to stay.

Oh you monsoon here you come,
Delight us with the rain.
We'll take a break for you,
And you wash away our pain.
