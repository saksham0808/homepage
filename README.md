# Saksham's homepage, version 1
**DEPRECIATED** in favour of [acehack.org](https://github.com/sakshamsharma/sakshamsharma.github.io)
Repository containing source code for my homepage (PHP, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap).
Please note, this was written at a time when I didn't know anything about Javascript or Web Dev. The code isn't worth much now :)
Inspite of that, it is live at [my college homepage](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sakshams/legacy.php).

**Highlights:**

1. Separate totally independent PHP files for header, footer, comments section and links to writeups. Include appropriate file to add the feature to the page.
2. Text contained in external markdown files.
3. Markdown converted to HTMl at server level using parsedown (credit: parsedown.org)
4. Contains carousel of some of my photographs.
5. Written in bootstrap.
6. Scaleable navbar written from scratch.
