<br><p><h4>Hello, Namaste, Bonjour!</h4></p>
<p>
I am a soon-to-be sophomore student of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; also known as IIT Kanpur.<br></p>
<p>
Some would say I am one of the good coders of my batch. Trying not to sound too complacent, I believe I am, am always coding up something new, this website being one of them, coded it up all from scratch to have a good grip over web-development. Well, I wanted to make a website I could be proud of for a while, and not look back at it to think it is kiddish.</p>
<p>Getting back to the topic, I feel my journey into the world of coding has been an exceptional one. From a person who didn't even know arrays ( yep! ) when he came to college, to a person coding complete websites from scratch and such stuff, yes it has been extraordinary. <br>
I figured it would be a good idea if my journey through the world of code is penned down.

<p><h4>Some bits about me:</h4></p>
<div class="bits">
	<p>I'm a fun loving, tall, lanky guy who codes 80% of the time of the day, mostly with classic rock playing on my headphones.</p>
	<p>Apart from coding, I am into PC gaming, badminton, photography and literature.</p>
	<p>I recently rekindled my interest in writing and poetry. Would be posting some things here soon in the musings section.</p>

	<span>I <3 Linux</span>
	<p>Yes, I love Linux. Literally everything about it. I have installed Arch linux (my favorite, forever. Period.) around 25-30 times, in different scenarios, on different laptops, and thus have a well rounded experience.
		Not just install, I tend to customize it a lot, have a look at 'my-rc-files' repo on my git.
	</p>
<br>
	<span>Vim</span>
	<p>Vim is my favorite (wait, not just favorite, ONLY) text editor. One vim for everything under the sun. My vimrc is quite a decent looking one too. Try giving it a look for some good ideas about how to get more productive with vim. I believe everyone would find something useful in there. It's there in the above mentioned repo.</p>

	<span>Photography</span>
	<p>Although I spend too much time coding, I tend to be on the lookout for photogenic scenes whenever I leave my room. Have a look at some of my Amatuer photographs <mark><a href="carousel.php">here</a></mark>.</p>
